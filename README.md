# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was designed to easily access my notes that I took to get ready for the upcoming coding bootcamp I am enrolled in. I felt most comfortable with the CSS section, but felt the most challenged during the JavaScript Section.

## Installation

## Usage

This Webpage can be used to easily find and navigate through to find notes I have taken on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git in preparation for the coding bootcamp. If you open the DevTools console by right clicking anywhere on the webpage, selecting "inspect" and then selecting "console" you can see the JavaScript listing all topics, and suggesting a topic to study next.
